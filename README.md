A knigt of your guild.

## What is this?

It's a discord bot run in [node.js](https://nodejs.org)</br>
Everyone can use it through [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817739856095608832&permissions=4294967295&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FYrs5HEYdJq&response_type=code&scope=identify%20bot) the bot.</br>
You also can build this bot yourself.</br>
But please don't re-upload the code or set your bot public.

## How to use?

If you chooseing build this bot yourself, you should prepare some files like `.env`.</br>
And also should prepare your databases for storage some data.</br>
I think maybe you shuld follow these steps.

1. Clone this project or download .zip file from [releases](https://github.com/SJ-Bots/KnightSora/releases).
2. Create file `.env` in the root of bot files.
3. Make sure the `.env` file's contents like this

```.env
token = Your_Bot_Token
prefix = Your_Bot_Prefix
address = Your_Database_Address(can be localhost)
account = Your_Database_Account(Warning! Set the account not root can protect your database!)
password = Your_Database_Password(Warning! Set anything else but don't set it same as your account can protect your database!)
database = The_Database_Which_You_Want_To_Use
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't Set Account & Password **Same** Or Using **ROOT** can protect your database

Now you can host your bot!
